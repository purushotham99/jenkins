&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Persistence&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * These objects are persisted as a part of {@link Project} by XStream.
&nbsp; * The save operation happens without any notice, and the restore operation
&nbsp; * happens without calling the constructor, just like Java serialization.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * So generally speaking, derived classes should use instance variables
&nbsp; * only for keeping configuration. You can still store objects you use
&nbsp; * for processing, like a parser of some sort, but they need to be marked
&nbsp; * as {@code transient}, and the code needs to be aware that they might
&nbsp; * be null (which is the case when you access the field for the first time
&nbsp; * the object is restored.)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Build steps are instantiated when the user saves the job configuration, and sticks
&nbsp; * around in memory until the job configuration is overwritten.

&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * This method is introduced for preserving compatibility with plugins written for earlier versions of Hudson,
&nbsp;     * which never run multiple builds of the same job in parallel. Such plugins often assume that the outcome
&nbsp;     * of the previous build is completely available, which is no longer true when we do concurrent builds.
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * To minimize the necessary code change for such plugins, {@link BuildStep} implementations can request
&nbsp;     * Hudson to externally perform synchronization before executing them. This behavior is as follows:
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;dl&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;dt&gt;{@link BuildStepMonitor#BUILD}
&nbsp;     * &lt;dd&gt;
&nbsp;     * This {@link BuildStep} is only executed after the previous build is fully
&nbsp;     * completed (thus fully restoring the earlier semantics of one build at a time.)
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;dt&gt;{@link BuildStepMonitor#STEP}
&nbsp;     * &lt;dd&gt;
&nbsp;     * This {@link BuildStep} is only executed after the same step in the previous build is completed.
&nbsp;     * For build steps that use a weaker assumption and only rely on the output from the same build step of
&nbsp;     * the early builds, this improves the concurrency.
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;dt&gt;{@link BuildStepMonitor#NONE}
&nbsp;     * &lt;dd&gt;
&nbsp;     * No external synchronization is performed on this build step. This is the most efficient, and thus
&nbsp;     * &lt;b&gt;the recommended value for newer plugins&lt;/b&gt;. Wherever necessary, you can directly use {@link CheckPoint}s
&nbsp;     * to perform necessary synchronizations.
&nbsp;     * &lt;/dl&gt;
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;strong&gt;Migrating Older Implementations:&lt;/strong&gt;
&nbsp;     * If you are migrating {@link BuildStep} implementations written for earlier versions of Hudson,
&nbsp;     * here&#39;s what you can do:
&nbsp;     *
&nbsp;     * &lt;ul&gt;
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;
&nbsp;     * To demand the backward compatible behavior from Jenkins, leave this method unoverridden,
&nbsp;     * and make no other changes to the code. This will prevent users from reaping the benefits of concurrent
&nbsp;     * builds, but at least your plugin will work correctly, and therefore this is a good easy first step.
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;
&nbsp;     * If your build step doesn&#39;t use anything from a previous build (for example, if you don&#39;t even call
&nbsp;     * {@link Run#getPreviousBuild()}), then you can return {@link BuildStepMonitor#NONE} without making further
&nbsp;     * code changes and you are done with migration.
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;
&nbsp;     * If your build step only depends on {@link Action}s that you added in the previous build by yourself,
&nbsp;     * then you only need {@link BuildStepMonitor#STEP} scope synchronization. Return it from this method
&nbsp;     * ,and you are done with migration without any further code changes.
&nbsp;     * &lt;li&gt;
&nbsp;     * If your build step makes more complex assumptions, return {@link BuildStepMonitor#NONE} and use
&nbsp;     * {@link CheckPoint}s directly in your code. The general idea is to call {@link CheckPoint#block()} before
&nbsp;     * you try to access the state from the previous build.
&nbsp;     * &lt;/ul&gt;
