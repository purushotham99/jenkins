&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Special means of indicating that an executable will proceed in the background without consuming a native thread ({@link Executor}).
&nbsp; * May be thrown from {@link Executable#run} after doing any preparatory work synchronously.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;{@link Executor#isActive} will remain true (even though {@link Executor#isAlive} is not) until {@link #completed} is called.
&nbsp; * The thrower could hold on to a reference to this instance as a handle to call {@link #completed},
&nbsp; * or look it up later via {@link Executor#getAsynchronousExecution}.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;The execution may not extend into another Jenkins session; if you wish to model a long-running execution, you must schedule a new task after restart.
&nbsp; * This class is not serializable anyway.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Mainly intended for use with {@link OneOffExecutor} (from a {@link FlyweightTask}), of which there could be many,
&nbsp; * but could also be used with a heavyweight executor even though the number of executors is bounded by node configuration.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;{@link ResourceController}/{@link ResourceActivity}/{@link ResourceList}/{@link Resource} are not currently supported.
&nbsp; * Nor are {@link hudson.model.Queue.Task#getSubTasks} other than the primary task.
&nbsp; * @since 1.607
