&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Marks a field, a method, or a class for automatic discovery, so that Hudson can locate
&nbsp; * implementations of {@link ExtensionPoint}s automatically.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * (In contrast, in earlier Hudson, the registration was manual.)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * In a simplest case, put this on your class, and Hudson will create an instance of it
&nbsp; * and register it to the appropriate {@link ExtensionList}.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * If you&#39;d like Hudson to call
&nbsp; * a factory method instead of a constructor, put this annotation on your static factory
&nbsp; * method. Hudson will invoke it and if the method returns a non-null instance, it&#39;ll be
&nbsp; * registered. The return type of the method is used to determine which {@link ExtensionList}
&nbsp; * will get the instance.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * Finally, you can put this annotation on a static field if the field contains a reference
&nbsp; * to an instance that you&#39;d like to register.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This is the default way of having your implementations auto-registered to Hudson,
&nbsp; * but Hudson also supports arbitrary DI containers for hosting your implementations.
&nbsp; * See {@link ExtensionFinder} for more details.
