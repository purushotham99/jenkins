&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Object that contributes additional information, behaviors, and UIs to {@link ModelObject}
&nbsp; * (more specifically {@link Actionable} objects, which most interesting {@link ModelObject}s are.)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * {@link Action}s added to a model object creates additional URL subspace under the parent model object,
&nbsp; * through which it can interact with users. {@link Action}s are also capable of exposing themselves
&nbsp; * to the left hand side menu of a {@link ModelObject} (for example to {@link Project}, {@link Build}, and etc.)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Some actions use the latter without the former (for example, to add a link to an external website),
&nbsp; * while others do the former without the latter (for example, to just draw some graphs in {@code floatingBox.jelly}),
&nbsp; * and still some others do both.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * If an action has a view named {@code floatingBox.jelly},
&nbsp; * it will be displayed as a floating box on the top page of
&nbsp; * the target {@link ModelObject}. (For example, this is how
&nbsp; * the JUnit test result trend shows up in the project top page.
&nbsp; * See {@code TestResultProjectAction}.)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * On the target {@link ModelObject} page, actions are rendered as an item in the side panel
&nbsp; * by the &quot;/lib/hudson:actions&quot; jelly tag, but you can override this for your action by
&nbsp; * writing {@code action.jelly}. See the &quot;actions&quot; tag for what the default handling is and
&nbsp; * tweak from there. One of the use cases of this is to show nested actions, like where
&nbsp; * Jenkins show the option to wipe out the workspace inside the workspace link:
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
&nbsp; * &lt;l:task icon=&quot;icon-folder icon-md&quot;  href=&quot;${url}/ws/&quot; title=&quot;${%Workspace}&quot;&gt;
&nbsp; *   &lt;l:task icon=&quot;icon-delete icon-md&quot;  href=&quot;${url}/wipeOutWorkspace&quot; title=&quot;${%Wipe Out Workspace}&quot; /&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;/l:task&gt;
&nbsp; * }&lt;/pre&gt;
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Persistence&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Actions are often persisted as a part of {@link Actionable}
&nbsp; * (for example with {@link Build}) via XStream. In some other cases,
&nbsp; * {@link Action}s are transient and not persisted (such as
&nbsp; * when it&#39;s used with {@link Job}).
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * The {@link Actionable#replaceAction(Action)}, {@link Actionable#addOrReplaceAction(Action)}, and
&nbsp; * {@link Actionable#removeAction(Action)} methods use {@link Object#equals} to determine whether to update
&nbsp; * or replace or remove an {@link Action}. As such, {@link Action} subclasses that provide a deep
&nbsp; * {@link Object#equals} will assist in reducing the need for unnecessary persistence.
