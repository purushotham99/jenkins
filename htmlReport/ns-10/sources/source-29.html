&nbsp; * Represents some resources that are set up for the duration of a build
&nbsp; * to be torn down when the build is over.

&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This is often used to run a parallel server necessary during a build,

&nbsp; * X server for performing UI tests, etc.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;

&nbsp; * we can simplify the build script. {@link Environment} abstraction also gives
&nbsp; * you guaranteed &quot;tear down&quot; phase, so that such resource won&#39;t keep running forever.
