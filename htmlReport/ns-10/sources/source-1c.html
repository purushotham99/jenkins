&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Provides a mechanism for synchronizing build executions in the face of concurrent builds.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * At certain points of a build, {@link BuildStep}s and other extension points often need
&nbsp; * to refer to what happened in its earlier build. For example, a {@link SCM} check out
&nbsp; * can run concurrently, but the changelog computation requires that the check out of the
&nbsp; * earlier build has completed. Or if Hudson is sending out an e-mail, he needs to know
&nbsp; * the result of the previous build, so that he can decide an e-mail is necessary or not.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Check pointing is a primitive mechanism to provide this sort of synchronization.
&nbsp; * These methods can be only invoked from {@link Executor} threads.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Each {@link CheckPoint} instance represents unique check points. {@link CheckPoint}
&nbsp; * instances are normally created as a static instance, because two builds of the same project
&nbsp; * needs to refer to the same check point instance for synchronization to happen properly.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * This class defines a few well-known check point instances. plugins can define
&nbsp; * their additional check points for their own use.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;Note that not all job types support checkpoints.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * {@code JUnitResultArchiver} provides a good example of how a {@link Recorder} can
&nbsp; * depend on its earlier result.
