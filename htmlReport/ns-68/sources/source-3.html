&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *     This tag works like &amp;lt;j:forEach&amp;gt; and repeatedly evaluate the body so that

&nbsp;     *     used when a new copy is inserted.
&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *     h4. HTML structure
&nbsp;     *       This tag mainly produces the nested DIVs with CSS classes as follows:
&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *       {noformat}
&nbsp;     *       &amp;lt;div class=&quot;repeated-container&quot;&amp;gt;   // container for the whole thing

&nbsp;     *           ... copy 1 ...

&nbsp;     *       {noformat}
&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *       The &#39;repeated-chunk&#39; DIVs will also have additional CSS classes that represent
&nbsp;     *       their positions among siblings:
&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *         first : first chunk among the siblings

&nbsp;     *         middle: neither first nor last
&nbsp;     *         only  : it is the only chunk (automatically get first and last at the same time)
&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *     h4. Usage Note
&nbsp;     *       The caller of this tag should define a button to add a new copy and delete
&nbsp;     *       the current copy. Such buttons should have &#39;repeatable-add&#39; CSS class and
&nbsp;     *       &#39;repeatable-delete&#39; CSS class respectively (it can have other CSS classes),
&nbsp;     *       so that their event handlers get properly wired up.
&nbsp;     * 
&nbsp;     *       The positional CSS classes on &#39;repeated-chunk&#39; DIVs (as explained above)
&nbsp;     *       can be used to control the visibility of such buttons. For example, this allows
&nbsp;     *       you to hide &#39;delete&#39; button if there&#39;s only one item, or only show &#39;add&#39; button
&nbsp;     *       on the last row. There are a few CSS classes already defined in style.css
